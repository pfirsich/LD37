# GAME NAME
GAME NAME is a movement based ego shooter, where you have to collect as many beacons as you can.
Destroy the drones to gain time and ammo for your energy grenades.

I strongly advise you to watch a clip of some moves you can do in the game [HERE](YOUTUBELINK)

## Tips
* You can double jump!
* Jump and rocket boost at the same time!
* Sometimes you want to combine left and right click
* You can use the grenades to boost yourself on walls
